# SLICING
# in python, a list is a collection of ordered elements
# list slicing is a way to extract a subset of elements from a list by specifying a range of indices
# list slicing is done through a colon operator
# the sytax for list slicing is as follows
# list[start:end:step]
# start => index of the first element you want to include in the slice(inclusive)
# end => index of the last element you want to include in the slice(exclusive)
# step => the interval between each element in the slice (optiional, default is 1)
